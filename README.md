# Blown-Away-weather

I really enjoyed making this application event though it was very challenging it was enjoyable to figure out the solution to the problems.

You can see my work has blown it away. Just a bit of humor here is a link to see my work [Blown-Away-weather](https://smiliekay.github.io/Blown-Away-weather/)

## Main Goals 
My goal was to make a weather site that used a weather API to show the current weather as well as the 5 day forecast. I also wanted to be able to display the date , humidity and high and low temp. I wanted to be able to have images that changed with the weather , to be able to search for a city and to have my last 5 searches displayed and clickable so I could go back to previous searches.
